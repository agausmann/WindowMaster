# Case Files

The case is made from two laser-cut acrylic parts, the top and bottom plate.
The top plate has holes for the encoders, LEDs, and the ST-Link header, and it
is mounted to the PCB by the fasteners on the encoder stems. The bottom plate
has holes to access the DFU/Reset buttons on the back of the PCB, and is
attached to the front plate with M2.5 bolts and 15mm standoffs.

I've provided the FreeCAD model and two SVGs generated from it, one for the top
plate, and one for the bottom plate. Those SVGs can be provided to a
laser-cutting service like Ponoko; I'd recommend using 2mm clear acrylic
sheets. The dimensions in the SVG files are in millimeters.
