A physical controller for the Windows Volume Mixer (sndvol).

This project is made up of multiple hardware and software parts:

- `pcb/` - KiCad design files for the controller PCB.

- `case/` - A laser-cut acrylic case for the PCB.

- `firmware/` - Firmware running on the controller.

- PC software to actually control the volume. (TODO)
