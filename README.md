# WindowMaster

A physical controller for the Windows Volume Mixer (sndvol).

This project is made up of multiple hardware and software parts:

- `pcb/` - KiCad design files for the controller PCB.

- `case/` - A laser-cut acrylic case for the PCB.

- `firmware/` - Firmware running on the controller.

- `host-controller/` (**WIP**) - PC software to bridge between the controller
  and the system volume mixer.
